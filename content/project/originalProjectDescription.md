As video games become increasingly more common, teachers and parents are increasingly
using them to supplement their childrenâ€™s educations in a fun way. Educational games may
improve student engagement and incentivize learning. In the past, games such as the Oregon
Trail, Number Munchers, SimCity, the Dr. Brain series, and Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing
have all been used to either teach or reinforce ideas.


Your team will design and prototype a new educational video game. This game must
be suitable for students between 4th to 8th grade (late elementary school or middle school).
You may choose to narrow the target age range. The target demographic will likely have an
effect on the text, concepts, and mechanics that you want to use; Young children may not
have the reading, motor, or analytical skills required for some designs.


The game must have an educational component. The Massachusetts Department of Education and Common Core standards can give some suggestions for topics that are appropriate for different age levels.


This project is open-ended. You have freedom to choose the language, engine, genre, and topic for your game.
