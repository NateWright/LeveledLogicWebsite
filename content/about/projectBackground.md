Computers are built on fundamental operations done by logic gates. 
Logic gates are simple devices that often taking in a few inputs and combining them to make a simple output.
Logic gates make it possible to add, subtract, multiply and many other complex operations.
These complex operations make up microprocessors which are used in lots of devices from credit cards to data centers.
This is why it is important for children to be introduced to logic gates, so they can understand todays technology 
and possibly pursue it as a field.
